COMMANDS
       -z      Like SPACE, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window size.

       ESC-SPACE
              Like SPACE, but scrolls a full screenful, even if it reaches end-of-file in the process.

       ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
              Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

       d or ^D
              Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u commands.

       b or ^B or ESC-v
              Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.

       w      Like ESC-v, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window size.

       y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K
              Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.  Warning: some systems use ^Y as a special job control character.

       u or ^U
              Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u commands.

       K or Y Like k, but continues to scroll beyond the beginning of the file.
